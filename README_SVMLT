the two folders contain 3 codes to be run successfully to get the boundary flcutuation spectrum for circular and planar interface respectively.

codes in the circular_boundary folder:

1) get_bnd_svm.py - getting boundary using SVM
2) avg_bnd.py - obtaining an average boundary from the different boundaries obtained
3) spectrum_calc.py - calculating the flcutuation spectrum

codes in the planar_boundary folder: 

1) get_bnd_svm.py - getting boundary using SVM
2) avg_bnd.py - obtaining an average boundary from the different boundaries obtained
3) spectrum_calc.py - calculating the flcutuation spectrum

The codes need to be run in the order in which they are written above. 

The data files needed for a test run are provided in the data_file folder for each of these cases. The lipids have been classified into ordered and disordered according to the lipid type in both these cases.

The data files are of the form: x,y,identity. Identity is given a 0 for saturated and 1 for unsaturated lipids.
